# Multilabel classification on Stack Overflow tags
This project aims to predict tags for posts from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). To solve this task we use multilabel classification. This is based on a project by partoftheorigin

### Libraries

In this task you will need the following libraries:
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) — a package for scientific computing.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) — a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) — a tool for data mining and data analysis.
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) — a platform to work with natural language.

## Dataset
- Dataset of post titles from StackOverflow
- All data required for this project is into the folder `/data`.

## Transforming text to a vector
- Transformed text data to numeric vectors using bag-of-words and TF-IDF.

## MultiLabel classifier
[MultiLabelBinarizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer.html) to transform labels in a binary form and the prediction will be a mask of 0s and 1s.

[Logistic Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for Multilabel classification
- Coefficient = 10
- L2-regularization technique

## Evaluation
Results evaluated using several classification metrics:
- [Accuracy](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)
- [F1-score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
- [Area under ROC-curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)
- [Area under precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score)
